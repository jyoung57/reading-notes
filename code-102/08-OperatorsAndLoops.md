>## What is an Expression?  

- An expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. There are 2 types of expressions; those that have side effects, and those that are purely *evaluate*.  

- We reviewed Operators in the last Reading Note [See Control Flow reading note](https://jyoung57.github.io/reading-notes/code-102/07-ControlFlow)  

>## Loops 

- A *for* statement loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.  Example; for (initialization; condition; afterthought) statement  
- A *while* statement execute its statement as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.  Example; while (condition) statement
