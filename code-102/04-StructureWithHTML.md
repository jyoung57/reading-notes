># HTML Basics  

1. What is HTML?  HyperText Markup Language  
2. HTML is a markup langauge that defines the structure of your content.  
3. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose different parts of teh content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.  

># HTML Definitions  

* **Opening Tag**: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.  
* **Closing Tag**: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.  
* **Content**: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.  
* **Element**: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.  
* **Nesting**: Putting elements within other elements.   
* **Semantics**: refers to the meaning of a piece of code.
