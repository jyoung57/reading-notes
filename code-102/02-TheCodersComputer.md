# Reflection and Discussion

Today we learned about what items would be needed for a Coder's Computer.  The following are items we installed:  
-Text Editor *(Visual Studio Code)*  
-Installed serveral extentions within the Text Editor  
-Created a terminal and utilized codes for different prompts  
-Created files within or newly created terminal  

## Questions

1.What are four important features to look for in a text editor?  
-Code Completion, syntax highlighting, variety of themes, ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions.

2.What do the following commands do?  
-pwd - displays (/home/username) or print working directory  
-ls - displays a list of folders  
-cd - change directories  
-mkdir - make directory  
-touch - updates the file  

3.Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are enered into the command line?
(Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)  
-cd projects - change to the projects directory  
-mkdir new-project - create a new directory named new-project  
-touch new-project/newfile.md - change the name of the new-project file to newfile.md  
-ls projects/new-project - displays folders within projects/new-project folder
