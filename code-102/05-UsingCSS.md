There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:  
- External CSS - With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!  Example: <link rel="stylesheet" href=mystyle.css">  
- Internal CSS - An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style. Example: body {background-color: linen;}  
- Inline CSS - An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element. Example: < h1 style="color:blue;text-align:center;">This is a heading< /h>
