># What is Control Flow?  

- Control flow: Is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.  
- Functions: A block of code designed to perform a particular task.  It's executed when "something" invokes it.  
- Operator - This assigns a value to a variable.  

># Types of Operaters  

- Assignment Operaters: An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. Example; x=f()  
- Comparison Operators: A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true.  Example; true/false with ===  
- Arithmetic Operators: An arithmetic operator takes numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value.  Example; math.  
- Bitwise Operators: A bitwise operator treats their operands as a set of 32 bits (zeros and ones), rather than as decimal, hexadecimal, or octal numbers.  This uses binary representation.  
- Logical Operators: Logical operators are typically used with Boolean (logical) values; when they are, they return a Boolean value. However, the && and "||" operators actually return the value of one of the specified operands, so if these operators are used with non-Boolean values, they may return a non-Boolean value.  Example; And, Or, Not.  
- BigInt Operators: A special numeric type that provides support for integers of arbitrary length.  
- String Operators: In addition to the comparison operators, which can be used on string values, the concatenation operator (+) concatenates two string values together, returning another string that is the union of the two operand strings.  
- Conditional Operator: An operator that requires three operands.  Similar to if/then statements.  
- Comma Operator: ???  
- Unary Operators: A unary operation is an operation with only one operand. 
- Relational Operators: A relational operator compares its operands and returns a Boolean value based on whether the comparison is true. 

># Functions: 

- Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. 

## Function Declarations: 

* The name of the function. 
* A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas. 
* The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { /* … */ }.
