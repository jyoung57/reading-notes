- ***What is JavaScript?:*** A lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.  

># 4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable:  

* Using var  
* Using let  
* Using const

*  What makes a computer a computer?  
Input > Storage > Processing > Output  

* What is a binary number system?  
Consist of 2 digits, 0 and 1.  Any numbers can be created from these two numbers. The binary number system allows you to create any number you would like.  Text, pictures, vidoes, graphics and sound can also be created by numbers.  

* What are circuits?  
Every input or output is some type of information that can be on or off by 1's and 0's.  A computer is a machine with multiple circuits that provide information.  

* How computers work?  
Input is the user entering the information (with a mouse, keyboard, mic, etc.) Memory stores the info.  CPU is the processor for the computer.  Output is how the information is delivered (monitor, speakers, etc).  

* How Computers Work:  
Circuits, chips, pluts, wires, speakers:  This is all hardware.  
Games, apps, websites, creative:  This is all software.  
The CPU is the processor that controls the entire computer.  The software is what tells the CPU what circuits to use to send information through the hardware.  

># When to Use JavaScript const?  
* If you want a general rule: always declare variables with const.  

* If you think the value of the variable can change, use let.

* string - words within ''  
* number - numbers not words 
* bigint - numbers so big they are too big to enter  
* boolean - if using true/false  
*undefined - has no true definition, not assigned  
* symbols - a built in object whose constructor returns a symbol  
* null - the equivalent of nothing.  Not 0, but nothing
