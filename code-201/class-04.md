### Creating Hyperlinks

1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?

- A basic link gets wrapped in an <a> with an href attribtute. It looks like this <a href></a>.

2. The href attribute contains what information?

- The href attribute contains the web address.

3. What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?

- Screen reader users like jumping around from link to link on the page, and reading links out of context.

* Search engines use link text to index target files, so it is a good idea to include keywords in your link text to effectively describe what is being linked to.

* Visual readers skim over the page rather than reading every word, and their eyes will be drawn to page features that stand out, like links. They will find descriptive link text useful.

* Don't repeat the URL as part of the link text — URLs look ugly, and sound even uglier when a screen reader reads them out letter by letter.

* Don't say "link" or "links to" in the link text — it's just noise. Screen readers tell people there's a link. Visual users will also know there's a link, because links are generally styled in a different color and underlined (this convention generally shouldn't be broken, as users are used to it).

* Keep your link text as short as possible — this is helpful because screen readers need to interpret the entire link text.

* Minimize instances where multiple copies of the same text are linked to different places. This can cause problems for screen reader users, if there's a list of links out of context that are labeled "click here", "click here", "click here".

## CSS Layout

### CSS Layout: Normal Flow and Positioning

1. What is meant by “normal flow”?

- Normal flow is how the document is layed out before any CSS additions. You should begin your page in normal flow then add your styles after.

2. What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?

- By default, a block-level element's content fills the available inline space of the parent element containing it, growing along the block dimension to accommodate its content. The size of inline-level elements is just the size of their content. You can set width or height on some elements that have a default display property value of inline, like <img>, but display value will still remain inline.

3. \_\_\_\_ positioning is the default for every html element.

- Static Positioning, which is it's "normal" position.

4. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.

- Absolute Positioning allows the developer to freely move the box around without limitations.

* It allows you to create isolated features that don't interfere with the layout of other elements on the page.

* You can adjust top, center, left or right.

5. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

- Absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one), fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport.

## Learn JS

### Functions-Reusable Blocks of Code

1. Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.

- Declaration declares the creation of variables and functions. Invocation executes a piece of code to retrieve its value.

2. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

- The values that are declared within a function when the function is called are known as an argument. Whereas, the variables that are defined when the function is declared are known as a parameter.

### 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.

- Job Interview Readiness - I personally think this will give my opportunity to use my experience partnering with other developers in Pair Programming to answer behavoiral questions during interviews. It will give me real worls scenarios to use while responding.

* Learning from fellow students - I beileve this will really help me learn better coding and overall better syntax when entering code. Being able to learn from others is always beneficial to making me a better developer.
