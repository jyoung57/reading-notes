### Creating Hyperlinks

1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?

- A basic link gets wrapped in an <a> with an href attribtute. It looks like this <a href></a>.

2. The href attribute contains what information?

- The href attribute contains the web address.

3. What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?

- Screen reader users like jumping around from link to link on the page, and reading links out of context.

* Search engines use link text to index target files, so it is a good idea to include keywords in your link text to effectively describe what is being linked to.

* Visual readers skim over the page rather than reading every word, and their eyes will be drawn to page features that stand out, like links. They will find descriptive link text useful.

* Don't repeat the URL as part of the link text — URLs look ugly, and sound even uglier when a screen reader reads them out letter by letter.

* Don't say "link" or "links to" in the link text — it's just noise. Screen readers tell people there's a link. Visual users will also know there's a link, because links are generally styled in a different color and underlined (this convention generally shouldn't be broken, as users are used to it).

* Keep your link text as short as possible — this is helpful because screen readers need to interpret the entire link text.

* Minimize instances where multiple copies of the same text are linked to different places. This can cause problems for screen reader users, if there's a list of links out of context that are labeled "click here", "click here", "click here".
