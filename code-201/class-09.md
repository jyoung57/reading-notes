## HTML Forms

1. Why are forms so important in web development?

* Web forms are one of the main points of interaction between a user and a website or application. Forms allow users to enter data, which is generally sent to a web server for processing and storage (see Sending form data later in the module), or used on the client-side to immediately update the interface in some way (for example, add another item to a list, or show or hide a UI feature).

2. When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?

* Before starting to code, it's always better to step back and take the time to think about your form.
* Keep it simple and stay focused: ask only for the data you absolutely need.
* From a user experience (UX) point of view, it's important to remember that the bigger your form, the more you risk frustrating people and losing users.

3. List 5 form elements and explain their importance.

* <form> - 
* <label> - 
* <input> - 
* <textarea > -
* <button> -
