## What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

* Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through â€” you will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually okay to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the error messages mean!

* Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error.

2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

* I usally am able to locate syntax errors relatively easy.  Just as the reading material stated, those usually give you some type of message.  But some of the logic errors I have encountered are things like, loops now adequately configured, css attmpts that just simply don't do anything, and functions that I just don't know how to configure. 

3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

*  My current carreer requires me to locate issues within the coding of our software.  This will benefit me in my ability to perform my current job or future jobs much easier. 

## The JavaScript Debugger

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

* The JavaScript debugger allows you to watch the value of variables and set breakpoints, places in your code that you want to pause execution and identify the problems that prevent your code from executing properly.

2. Define what a breakpoint is.

* A breakpoint is a point at which responsive web pages change their layouts. Breakpoints can be used to hide or show certain elements, change the font size, or even alter the site's overall layout.

3. What is the call stack?

* The JavaScript engines use the call stack to keep track of what functions are running -- a function is added to a stack when the engine reaches a function that needs to be executed, and it cleared from the stack when the function returns.
