># Reading-Class 14 - Psychological Safety

>## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

1. What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?

* Having a good work relationship with our peers.

* Creating bonds that allow people to be vulnerable.

* Creating an open space of verbal opportunity for everyone.

2. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.

* As a Team Lead in my previous company, I operated heavily on the pet peeve of knowing my audience.  What I mean by this was using my tools as a former coach and motivator to build my team from their own distinct individual levels. When I deliver a message to my entire team, the tone was always up beat and fun.  Even when the message was adverse, I would still spin it to try to bring a positive vibe amongst my employees.  At an individual level, I always opened conversation with areas that the employee was stellar, then I would lead into areas of opertunity, and end with another area that they excel in.  This approach never fully deflated the employee and always motivated them.  Even the oportunity areas were not negative.  Everyone can do better somewhere, so the message would be, let's focus on this area, so we can make you more well rounded.  Then we would focus on next steps for promotion or whatever they wanted to do.  This ALWAYS worked. 

3. What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?

* They simply get more accomplished because the employees have a good feeling about themselves, their team and their company.
